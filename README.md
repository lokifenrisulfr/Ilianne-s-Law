low-ℓ anomalies


The model fits low-ℓ anomalies like the “Axis of Evil” without requiring inflation

It uses a tunable recursive modulation function
It also embeds a time-recursive memory kernel over the primordial source function
With parameters like ε = 0.3, ω = 0.25, B = 1.1 and δ = π/6, I found a strong visual and residual match to the Planck TT power spectrum (ℓ = 2–20)
