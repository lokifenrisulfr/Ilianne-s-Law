This model offers an alternative to inflation-based explanations by introducing:

- A tunable **recursive modulation function**
- A time-recursive memory kernel embedded in the primordial source function

With parameter values:  
ε = 0.3, ω = 0.25, B = 1.1, and δ = π/6,  
I found strong **visual** and **residual** alignment with Planck TT power spectrum data for multipoles ℓ = 2–20.

### Naming and Intent

The name *Ilianne’s Law* is provisional and symbolic — it helped me stay connected to the vision behind the model. In my formal paper, I wrote:

> “If the principles outlined here are eventually recognized within formal physics, the author humbly proposes that the formulation be designated *Ilianne’s Law*, in recognition of the recursive systems logic underpinning this field-lattice framework. This naming is symbolic; the author is equally content for the contribution to remain anonymous if so preferred by the academic community.”

### Note

This repository is for open exploration. The math is still being tested. Peer critique is welcome — especially from those who can help formalize boundary recursion or derive constraints from first principles.

Thank you for reading,
