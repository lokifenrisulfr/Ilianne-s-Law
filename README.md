# Ilianne-s-Law
low-ℓ anomalies

           4/2/25 - i will open a folder with some of my work looking further into this. There were some helpful people on reddit and their suggestions should be shown and addressed.
The model fits low-ℓ anomalies like the “Axis of Evil” without requiring inflation

It uses a tunable recursive modulation function
It also embeds a time-recursive memory kernel over the primordial source function
With parameters like ε = 0.3, ω = 0.25, B = 1.1 and δ = π/6, I found a strong visual and residual match to the Planck TT power spectrum (ℓ = 2–20)

I am aware naming something is uselly frowned upon. The paper im Offically writing, where the name was keyed. I wrote:
¹If the principles outlined in this section are eventually recognized within formal physics, the author humbly proposes that the formulation may be designated Illianne’s Law, in recognition of the recursive systems logic underpinning this field-lattice framework. This naming is symbolic; the author is equally content for the contribution to remain anonymous if so preferred by the academic community.¹ 

i needed a placeholder and I humbly ask for understanding. The name gives meaning to the work i do, but i stay partial to my work.
